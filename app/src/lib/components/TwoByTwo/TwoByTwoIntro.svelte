			<strong>VoteKit Lite</strong> is a browser-based tool that lets you simulate voter rankings
			and see how different systems of election would convert those preferences to representation.
			For most purposes, we recommend that you construct preferences based on two groups of voters
			(called <strong>blocs</strong>) that have different sets of preferred candidates (called
			<strong>slates</strong>). You will get to adjust how large the groups are, how many candidates
			are in their slate, how cohesive the groups are, and whether there are strong candidates.
